          <strong>we started</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Hira Naushad started making cards as a hobby. Being a student of software engineering at NED

          University of Engineering & Technology, the idea of making cards as a business seemed pretty

          farfetched. But since her handmade cards were very popular, she, along with her partners Hina

          Akram and Rijaa Shamsuddin, took the opportunity and put forward this idea. This was the

          beginning of Banwalo</p>

          <strong>aim</strong>
        </h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Our aim is to provide beautiful handmade cards at your doorstep that will bring a smile on the

          faces of your loved ones. We do not take credit for all the designs and ideas but we add out

          special touch to it.

          Our objective is to provide the customer with the capability to design; a simple new way to

          design. Design shouldnâ€™/t be hard but somewhere along the way we became bogged down with

          expensive, complicated software that put design out of reach for most.

          We are here to change that with a tool that makes design simple for everyone.</p>
